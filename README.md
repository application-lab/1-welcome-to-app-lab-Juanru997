# About Me
Hi! My name is James and I am from Xiamen, a costal city in the southern part of China. I'm a sophormore right now but I'm still unsure about what's my path for future and I'm still actually spending a hard time exploring it. I took an IMA course last year -- Interaction Lab, where I generated many ideas and put that into reality. I hope this semester would also be a fruitful year, so that I sign up for Application Lab that I believe would learn a lot of practical stuff not only about how to write code but also how to come up with great ideas.
